title: Day Fifteen - Halfway point and next goals
---

I can't believe I'm already at the halfway point of the six-week batch I committed to. 

I spent a lot of the first half meeting people, exploring topics, and "learning how to Recurse". I'm glad that I've settled on two major projects for the second half. It's surprising how things have fallen into place after I was feeling so despairing only a couple days ago. 

## Goals for weeks 4-6

- Have the demo of my data pipeline project finished. This doesn't need to contain all the features you'd need for managing annotated ML datasets in production, but it should:
  - Store database in some kind of managed cloud solution
  - Have a rudimentary "orchestrator" that moves a dataset from one step of the process to the next
  - (Stretch goal) Have a basic web GUI? 
- Finish the [Codecrafters "Build Your Own Shell" challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) in Rust. I only started this yesterday, and it's so much fun. I'm learning a few things about the shell, while also getting more comfortable with Rust syntax and building a tangible project.
- Do a lot more pair programming to achieve these goals! I've been shy about "driving" during pairing so far, but now that I have two meaty projects to share, I feel more ready. 
- (Stretch goal) Give one programming talk and one non-programming talk (topics: TBD). 

All these goals feel ambitious to me, and I'm not sure I'll have them done in three more weeks. I need to start the job hunt after that, so I'll continue working on these projects and interacting with the RC community on the side.
