For the next six weeks I am attending the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), a self-directed programming retreat.

One of my goals during this retreat is to write short daily blog posts about what I've been working on. The main purpose of this exercise is self-accountability, but I also hope to practice communicating technical topics - and my enthusiasm for them. 

To set the scene: I'm in Brooklyn, it's snowing outside, and I'm cozily tucked into my hotel room with my tea. I spent yesterday exploring Manhattan and catching up with a dear friend, and now I'm feeling ready to work. 

I was overwhelmed by the number of people I met today but also excited by the level of enthusiasm. I also got the sense that it's safe to make big technical leaps here because there will be someone (faculty or peers) holding the mattress for you if you fall. 

## Major goals

- Learn Rust
    - [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html)
    - [Rustlings (exercises)](https://rustlings.cool/)
- Learn data engineering tools
    - [Seattle Data Guy's list](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/growing-from-analyst-to-data-engineer)

## Minor goals

- Explore other CS/systems areas
- Practice leetcoding
- Write this blog! 
- Bonus fun project: create conlanging software
    - See how many aspects of a conlang I can randomly generate: phonetics/phonology, lexicon, morphology, syntax?
