title: Day Nine - Rock-paper-scissors in Rust
---

Today I paired with Farid and Marc on rock-paper-scissors in Rust, which was extremely fun and satisfying! I should mention this is the first Rust code I've written from scratch. 

[Here's our code](https://github.com/esokada/rock-paper-scissors/blob/main/src/main.rs), if you're interested. 

## Things I learned in pairing

- Named loops! I recall reading about this in the Rust book, but Marc pointed out a handy situation to use them. 
- Remember that loops also have scope.
- Initializing an empty String, then using push_str() to push a string slice onto it. 
This is one way of dealing with the String vs. string slice issue. 
- Also using as_str() to deal with this issue, though I don't feel clear on which contexts this is needed in. This also belongs on my list of things to learn more about below. 
- Using the pattern matching syntax to deal with conditions, which feels really concise and powerful! 

## Things I'm still struggling with

- References and dereferencing in general
- .expect() and .unwrap()
  - I'm doing some reading about the Result and Option types
- I just need more finger exercise in this language

Please correct me if anything above seems not quite right!
